## Protocol for Energy Measurements in Neurnal Synapses

By using the ratiometric ATP sensor and the 2 lasers in alternate mode, one on in one frame and the other one in the following camera frame, as illustrated next:

The first step to have a easier way to extract information is first slipt the frames in to their corresponding channels, by just filling the info correcponig to the experement details:
